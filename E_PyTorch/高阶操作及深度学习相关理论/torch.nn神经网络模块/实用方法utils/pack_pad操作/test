like to choose those who are different from themselves while others prefer those who are similar to themselves.
People choose friends in differrent ways.
For instance, if an active and energetic guy proposes to his equally active and energetic friends that they should have some activities, it is more likely that his will agree at once.
When people have friends similar to themselves, they and their friends chat, play, and do thing together natually and harmoniously.
The result is that they all can feel relaxed and can trully enjoy each other's company.
